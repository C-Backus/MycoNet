Location based microblogging social network.

Borrowing a bit from Twitter: short character limit, replies, likes, reblog function (e.g., retweet)
However, location based means that a user can only see & interact with posts from other users within a specific predefined radius.

Features

  User profile
		username
		email

		user profile pic 
		User profile pages show history of posts

  Each post contains
		160 character limited text field
		shows likes & location below 
		replies below that
	
  GPS connectivity for location services
